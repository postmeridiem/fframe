# A FlutFrame Starter App
## Installation Instructions

- set up a firestore database (INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED)
- get yourself a firebase_config.dart file in the lib dir (an empty one is supplied (firebase_config.dart.clean) in your new lib dir)
- paste the firestore credentials in the config (which is gitignored to prevent upload to git) 
- start server with flutter run -d chrome  --web-port 8000 in the root dir of your project, assuming that is where you copied the example
- ADD IMPROVED INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING WITH FFRAME AS A PACKAGE
