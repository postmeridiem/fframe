// This file is intentionally left empty of substantial tests.

// The NavigationNotifier class, defined in 'navigation_service.dart', is a core
// part of the fframe navigation system. It is implemented as a singleton that is
// tightly coupled with other stateful singletons (e.g., SelectionState, TargetState)
// and is initialized deep within the Fframe widget tree.
//
// Due to this design, it is not feasible to write meaningful unit tests for it
// in isolation without a significant refactor of the core framework to support
// dependency injection for this class.
//
// The functionality of NavigationNotifier is instead covered by higher-level
// widget and integration tests that exercise the full navigation flow.
