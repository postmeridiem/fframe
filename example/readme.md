### a FlutFrame Starter App

- set up a firestore database (INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED)
- get yourself a firebase_config.dart file in the lib dir (an empty one is supplied (firebase_config.dart.clean) in your new lib dir)
- paste the firestore credentials in the config (which is gitignored to prevent upload to git) 
- start server with flutter run -d chrome  --web-port 8000 in the fframe_demo dir
- ADD IMPROVED INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING WITH FFRAME AS A PACKAGE
